Such systems, which have excited much research in the last decade, exhibit complex dynamical behaviors such as large-scale correlated motions and pattern formation due to hydrodynamic interactions. In this chapter, we summarize efforts to model these systems using particle simulations and continuum kinetic theories. After reviewing results from experiments and simulations, we present a general kinetic model for a suspension of self-propelled rodlike particles and discuss its stability and nonlinear dynamics. We then address extensions of this model that capture the effect of steric interactions in concentrated systems, the impact of conﬁnement and interactions with boundaries, and the effect of the suspending medium rheology. Finally, we discuss new active systems such as those that involve the interactions of biopolymers with immersed motor proteins and surface-bound suspensions of chemically powered particles.},

Cell–cell and cell–scaffold interactions which can drive cellular motion are accounted for by utilising relevant constitutive assumptions for the pressure in the cell phase. We reduce the model to a nonlinear reaction–diffusion equation for the cell phase, coupled to a moving boundary condition for the tissue edge, the diffusivity being dependent on the cell and scaffold volume fractions, cell and liquid viscosities and parameters that relate to cellular motion. Numerical simulations reveal that the reduced model admits three regimes for the evolution of the tissue edge at large time: linear, logarithmic and stationary. Employing travelling-wave and asymptotic analysis, we characterise these regimes in terms of parameters related to cellular production and motion.

              How does the swimming motion of bacteria affect the mixing of passive scalars in chaotic flows? Answers to this question can lead to a better understanding of the formation of algal blooms in oceans and lakes, as well as potentially useful applications in vaccine and biofuel production. Our experiments show that the presence of swimming
              Escherichia coli
              in two-dimensional chaotic flows can hinder large-scale transport and reduce flow chaoticity. Locally, however, bacteria can significantly enhance small-scale mixing. Our simulations also reveal the potential mechanism for these phenomena being the transient accumulation and dispersion of bacteria near regions of large fluid stretching.
            
          , 
            
              Understanding mixing and transport of passive scalars in active fluids is important to many natural (e.g., algal blooms) and industrial (e.g., biofuel, vaccine production) processes. Here, we study the mixing of a passive scalar (dye) in dilute suspensions of swimming
              Escherichia coli
              in experiments using a two-dimensional (2D) time-periodic flow and in a simple simulation. Results show that the presence of bacteria hinders large-scale transport and reduces overall mixing rate. Stretching fields, calculated from experimentally measured velocity fields, show that bacterial activity attenuates fluid stretching and lowers flow chaoticity. Simulations suggest that this attenuation may be attributed to a transient accumulation of bacteria along regions of high stretching. Spatial power spectra and correlation functions of dye-concentration fields show that the transport of scalar variance across scales is also hindered by bacterial activity, resulting in an increase in average size and lifetime of structures. On the other hand, at small scales, activity seems to enhance local mixing. One piece of evidence is that the probability distribution of the spatial concentration gradients is nearly symmetric with a vanishing skewness. Overall, our results show that the coupling between activity and flow can lead to nontrivial effects on mixing and transport.},

Experiments show that such interactions are non-trivial and can lead to transport barriers through which the scalar flux is significantly reduced. Using the Poincaré map, we show that these transport barriers coincide with the outermost members of elliptic LCSs known as Lagrangian vortex boundaries. Numerical simulations further show that elliptic LCSs can repel elongated swimmers and lead to swimmer depletion within Lagrangian coherent vortices. A simple mechanism shows that such depletion is due to the preferential alignment of elongated swimmers with the tangents of elliptic LCSs. Our results provide insights into understanding the transport of micro-organisms in complex flows with dynamical topological features from a Lagrangian viewpoint.},

	abstract = {In this review, we provide a theoretical introduction to Jeffery's equations for the orientation dynamics of an axisymmetric object in a flow at low Reynolds number, and review recent theoretical extensions and applications to the motions of self-propelled particles, so-called microswimmers, in external flows. Bacteria colonize human organs and medical devices even with flowing fluid, microalgae occasionally cause huge harmful toxic blooms in lakes and oceans, and recent artificial microrobots can migrate in flows generated in well-designed microfluidic chambers. The Jeffery equations, a simple set of ordinary differential equation, provide a useful building block in modeling, analyzing, and understanding these microswimmer dynamics in a flow current, in particular when incorporating the impact of the swimmer shape since the equations contain a shape parameter as a single scalar, known as the Bretherton parameter. The particle orientation forms a closed orbit when situated in a simple shear, and this non-uniform periodic rotational motion, referred to as Jeffery's orbits, is due to a constant of motion in the non-linear equation. After providing a theoretical introduction to microswimmer hydrodynamics and a derivation of the Jeffery equations, we discuss possible extensions to more general shapes, including those with rapid deformation. In the latter part of this review, simple mathematical models of microswimmers in different types of flow fields are described, with a focus on constants of motion and their relation to periodic motions in phase space, together with a breakdown of degenerate orbits, to discuss the stable, unstable, and chaotic dynamics of the system. The discussion in this paper will provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation for Jeffery's orbits and will be useful to understand the motions of microswimmers under various flows.},

	abstract = {Traveling wave charges lying on the insulating walls of an electrolyte-filled capillary, give rise to oscillatory modes which vanish when averaged over the period of oscillation. They also give rise to a {\textbackslash}emph\{zero mode\} (a unidirectional, time-independent velocity component) which does not vanish. The latter is a nonlinear effect caused by continuous symmetry-breaking due to the quadratic nonlinearity associated with the electric body force in the time-dependent Stokes equations. In this paper we provide a unified view of the effects arising in traveling wave electroosmosis and establish the universal behavior exhibited by the observables. We show that the incipient velocity profiles are self-similar implying that those obtained with a single experimental configuration, can be employed again to attain further insights without the need of repeating the experiment. Certain results from the literature are recovered as special cases of our formulation and we resolve certain paradoxes having appeared in the past. We present simple theoretical expressions, depending on a single fit parameter, that reproduce these profiles, which could thus provide a rapid test of consistency between our theory and future experiment. The effect becomes more pronounced when reducing the transverse dimension of the system, relative to the velocity direction, and increasing the excitation wavelength, and can therefore be employed for unidirectional transport of electrolytes in thin and long capillaries. General relations, expressing the zero mode velocity in terms of the electric potential and the geometry of the system only, can thus be easily adopted to suit alternative experimental settings.},

We ﬁnd that in some parameter regimes, some of these factors have a negligible effect on the long-time patterned state.

	abstract = {Pattern formation has been extensively studied in the context of evolving (timedependent) domains in recent years, with domain growth implicated in ameliorating problems of pattern robustness and selection, in addition to more realistic modelling in developmental biology. Most work to date has considered prescribed domains evolving as given functions of time, but not the scenario of concentration-dependent dynamics, which is also highly relevant in a developmental setting. Here, we study such concentration-dependent domain evolution for reaction–diffusion systems to elucidate fundamental aspects of these more complex models. We pose a general form of one-dimensional domain evolution and extend this to N -dimensional manifolds under mild constitutive assumptions in lieu of developing a full tissue-mechanical model. In the 1D case, we are able to extend linear stability analysis around homogeneous equilibria, though this is of limited utility in understanding complex pattern dynamics in fast growth regimes. We numerically demonstrate a variety of dynamical behaviours in 1D and 2D planar geometries, giving rise to several new phenomena, especially near regimes of critical bifurcation boundaries such as peak-splitting instabilities. For sufﬁciently fast growth and contraction, concentration-dependence can have an enormous impact on the nonlinear dynamics of the system both qualitatively and quantitatively. We highlight crucial differences between 1D evolution and higher-dimensional models, explaining obstructions for linear analysis and underscoring the importance of careful constitutive choices in deﬁning domain evolution in higher dimensions. We raise important questions in the modelling and analysis of biological systems, in addition to numerous mathematical questions that appear tractable in the one-dimensional setting, but are vastly more difﬁcult for higher-dimensional models.},

	abstract = {Chemotaxis phenomena govern the directed movement of micro-organisms in response to chemical stimuli. In this paper, we investigate two Keller–Segel systems of reaction-advection-diffusion equations modeling chemotaxis on thin networks. The distinction between two systems is driven by the rate of diffusion of the chemo-attractant. The intermediate rate of diffusion is modeled by a coupled pair of parabolic equations, while the rapid rate is described by a parabolic equation coupled with an elliptic one. Assuming the polynomial rate of growth of the chemotaxis sensitivity coefficient, we prove local wellposedness of both systems on compact metric graphs, and, in particular, prove existence of unique classical solutions. This is achieved by constructing sufficiently regular mild solutions via analytic semigroup methods and combinatorial description of the heat kernel on metric graphs. The regularity of mild solutions is shown by applying abstract semigroup results to semi-linear parabolic equations on compact graphs. In addition, for logistic type Keller–Segel systems we prove global well-posedness and, in some special cases, global uniform boundedness of solutions.},

In a typical TAP experiment a pulse of reactant gas of species A is injected into U, which is filled with chemically inert material, permeable to gas diffusion. Particles of catalyst are placed amid this inert medium, forming active sites where the reaction A → B may occur. On part of the boundary of U designated as the exit, a mixture of A and B can escape. We study the problem of determining the (molar) fraction of product gas in the mixture after U is fully evacuated. This fraction is identified with the reaction probability–that is, the probability of a single diffusing molecule reacting before leaving U. Specifically, we are interested in how this probability depends on the reaction rate constant k.},

The central problem is to determine the probability of reaction, or, equivalently, the yield of the reaction, in terms of the geometric parameters of the system and the chemical reaction constant. This is shown to be solved by a boundary value problem for the time-independent Feynman-Kac equation. Our focus here is on network-shaped (reactor) domains.

	abstract = {The study of pattern-forming instabilities in reaction–diffusion systems on growing or otherwise time-dependent domains arises in a variety of settings, including applications in developmental biology, spatial ecology, and experimental chemistry. Analyzing such instabilities is complicated, as there is a strong dependence of any spatially homogeneous base states on time, and the resulting structure of the linearized perturbations used to determine the onset of instability is inherently non-autonomous. We obtain general conditions for the onset and structure of diffusion driven instabilities in reaction–diffusion systems on domains which evolve in time, in terms of the time-evolution of the Laplace–Beltrami spectrum for the domain and functions which specify the domain evolution. Our results give sufﬁcient conditions for diffusive instabilities phrased in terms of differential inequalities which are both versatile and straightforward to implement, despite the generality of the studied problem. These conditions generalize a large number of results known in the literature, such as the algebraic inequalities commonly used as a sufﬁcient criterion for the Turing instability on static domains, and approximate asymptotic results valid for speciﬁc types of growth, or speciﬁc domains. We demonstrate our general Turing conditions on a variety of domains with different evolution laws, and in particular show how insight can be gained even when the domain changes rapidly in time, or when the homogeneous state is oscillatory, such as in the case of Turing–Hopf instabilities. Extensions to higherorder spatial systems are also included as a way of demonstrating the generality of the approach.},

As the application, the attractive motion of a single pulse solution for the Gray-Scott model toward the junction point is shown. It is also shown that a single front solution of Allen-Cahn equation is repulsive against the junction point. The motion of multi pulse solutions and front solutions are also treated.},

We obtain a rather complete description of the long-time dynamical behaviour for every case under consideration, which can be classiﬁed into three different types (called a trichotomy), according to the water ﬂow speeds in the river branches, which depend crucially on the topological structure of the graph representing the local river system and on the cross section areas of the branches. The trichotomy includes two different kinds of persistence states, and the state called “persistence below carrying capacity” here appears new.},

	title = {Energy-{Based} {Learning} {Algorithms} for {Analog} {Computing}: {A} {Comparative} {Study}},
	abstract = {Energy-based learning algorithms have recently gained a surge of interest due to their compatibility with analog (post-digital) hardware. Existing algorithms include contrastive learning (CL), equilibrium propagation (EP) and coupled learning (CpL), all consisting in contrasting two states, and differing in the type of perturbation used to obtain the second state from the first one. However, these algorithms have never been explicitly compared on equal footing with same models and datasets, making it difficult to assess their scalability and decide which one to select in practice. In this work, we carry out a comparison of seven learning algorithms, namely CL and different variants of EP and CpL depending on the signs of the perturbations. Specifically, using these learning algorithms, we train deep convolutional Hopfield networks (DCHNs) on five vision tasks (MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100). We find that, while all algorithms yield comparable performance on MNIST, important differences in performance arise as the difficulty of the task increases. Our key findings reveal that negative perturbations are better than positive ones, and highlight the centered variant of EP (which uses two perturbations of opposite sign) as the best-performing algorithm. We also endorse these findings with theoretical arguments. Additionally, we establish new SOTA results with DCHNs on all five datasets, both in performance and speed. In particular, our DCHN simulations are 13.5 times faster with respect to Laborieux et al. [2021], which we achieve thanks to the use of a novel energy minimisation algorithm based on asynchronous updates, combined with reduced precision (16 bits).},

	abstract = {Neurite outgrowth (dendrites and axons) should be a stable, but easily regulated process to enable a neuron to make its appropriate network connections during development. We explore the dynamics of outgrowth in a mathematical continuum model of neurite elongation. The model describes the construction of the internal microtubule cytoskeleton, which results from the production and transport of tubulin dimers and their assembly into microtubules at the growing neurite tip. Tubulin is assumed to be largely synthesised in the cell body from where it is transported by active mechanisms and by diffusion along the neurite. It is argued that this construction process is a fundamental limiting factor in neurite elongation. In the model, elongation is highly stable when tubulin transport is dominated by either active transport or diffusion, but oscillations in length may occur when both active transport and diffusion contribute. Autoregulation of tubulin production can eliminate these oscillations. In all cases a stable steady-state length is reached, provided there is intrinsic decay of tubulin. Small changes in growth parameters, such as the tubulin production rate, can lead to large changes in length. Thus cytoskeleton construction can be both stable and easily regulated, as seems necessary for neurite outgrowth during nervous system development.},

              To study the systematic variation of dendrite diameters, we established a superresolution method that allows us to resolve dendrite diameters in
              Drosophila
              class IV dendritic arborization neurons, a model cell for studying branching morphogenesis. Interestingly, the diameters do not follow any of the known scaling laws. We propose a different scaling law that follows from two concepts: Terminal branches have the smallest diameters, whose average is about 230 nm, and there is an incremental increase in cross-sectional area needed to support each additional terminal branch. The law is consistent with the growing dendritic tips making the primary metabolic demand, which is supplied by microtubule-based transport. If the law generalizes to other neurons, it may facilitate segmentation in connectomic studies.
            
          , 
            
              The systematic variation of diameters in branched networks has tantalized biologists since the discovery of da Vinci’s rule for trees. Da Vinci’s rule can be formulated as a power law with exponent two: The square of the mother branch’s diameter is equal to the sum of the squares of those of the daughters. Power laws, with different exponents, have been proposed for branching in circulatory systems (Murray’s law with exponent 3) and in neurons (Rall’s law with exponent 3/2). The laws have been derived theoretically, based on optimality arguments, but, for the most part, have not been tested rigorously. Using superresolution methods to measure the diameters of dendrites in highly branched
              Drosophila
              class IV sensory neurons, we have found that these types of power laws do not hold. In their place, we have discovered a different diameter-scaling law: The cross-sectional area is proportional to the number of dendrite tips supported by the branch plus a constant, corresponding to a minimum diameter of the terminal dendrites. The area proportionality accords with a requirement for microtubules to transport materials and nutrients for dendrite tip growth. The minimum diameter may be set by the force, on the order of a few piconewtons, required to bend membrane into the highly curved surfaces of terminal dendrites. Because the observed scaling differs from Rall’s law, we propose that cell biological constraints, such as intracellular transport and protrusive forces generated by the cytoskeleton, are important in determining the branched morphology of these cells.},

	abstract = {Understanding the principles governing axonal and dendritic branching is essential for unravelling the functionality of single neurons and the way in which they connect. Nevertheless, no formalism has yet been described which can capture the general features of neuronal branching. Here we propose such a formalism, which is derived from the expression of dendritic arborizations as locally optimized graphs. Inspired by Ramo´ n y Cajal’s laws of conservation of cytoplasm and conduction time in neural circuitry, we show that this graphical representation can be used to optimize these variables. This approach allows us to generate synthetic branching geometries which replicate morphological features of any tested neuron. The essential structure of a neuronal tree is thereby captured by the density profile of its spanning field and by a single parameter, a balancing factor weighing the costs for material and conduction time. This balancing factor determines a neuron’s electrotonic compartmentalization. Additions to this rule, when required in the construction process, can be directly attributed to developmental processes or a neuron’s computational role within its neural circuit. The simulations presented here are implemented in an open-source software package, the ‘‘TREES toolbox,’’ which provides a general set of tools for analyzing, manipulating, and generating dendritic structure, including a tool to create synthetic members of any particular cell group and an approach for a model-based supervised automatic morphological reconstruction from fluorescent image stacks. These approaches provide new insights into the constraints governing dendritic architectures. They also provide a novel framework for modelling and analyzing neuronal branching structures and for constructing realistic synthetic neural networks.},

Results: Here we show that the microtubule minus-enddirected motor dynein is required for the polarized targeting of dendrite-speciﬁc cargo, such as AMPA receptors. To directly examine how dynein motors contribute to polarized dendritic transport, we established a trafﬁcking assay in hippocampal neurons to selectively probe speciﬁc motor protein activity. This revealed that, unlike kinesins, dynein motors drive cargo selectively into dendrites, governed by their mixed microtubule array. Moreover, axon-speciﬁc cargos, such as presynaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin, are redirected to dendrites by coupling to dynein motors. Quantitative modeling demonstrated that bidirectional dynein-driven transport on mixed microtubules provides an efﬁcient mechanism to establish a stable density of continuously renewing vesicles in dendrites.
Conclusions: These results demonstrate a powerful approach to study speciﬁc motor protein activity inside living cells and imply a key role for dynein in dendritic transport. We propose that dynein establishes the initial sorting of dendritic cargo and additional motor proteins assist in subsequent delivery.},

We introduce a new technique for detecting holes in coverage by means of homology, an algebraic topological invariant. The impetus for these techniques is a completion of network communication graphs to two types of simplicial complexes: the nerve complex and the Rips complex. The former gives information about coverage intersection of individual sensor nodes, and is very difﬁcult to compute. The latter captures connectivity in terms of inter-node communication: it is easy to compute but does not in itself yield coverage data. We obtain coverage data by using persistence of homology classes for Rips complexes. These homological invariants are computable: we provide simulation results.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2301.01264},
	abstract = {A common type of cytoskeletal morphology involves multiple converging microbutubules with their minus ends collected and stabilized by a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in the interior of the cell. This arrangement enables the ballistic transport of cargo bound to microtubules, both dynein mediated transport towards the MTOC and kinesin mediated transport away from it, interspersed with diffusion for unbound cargo-motor complexes. Spatial and temporal positioning of the MTOC allows for bidirectional transport towards and away from specific organelles and locations within the cell and also the sequestering and subsequent dispersal of dynein transported cargo. The general principles governing dynamics, efficiency and tunability of such transport in the MTOC vicinity is not fully understood. To address this, we develop a one-dimensional model that includes advective transport towards an attractor (such as the MTOC), and diffusive transport that allows particles to reach absorbing boundaries (such as cellular membranes). We calculated the mean first passage time (MFPT) for cargo to reach the boundaries as a measure of the effectiveness of sequestering (large MFPT) and diffusive dispersal (low MFPT). The MFPT experiences a dramatic growth in magnitude, transitioning from a low to high MFPT regime (dispersal to sequestering) over a window of cargo attachment/detachment rates that is close to in vivo values. We find that increasing either the attachment or detachment rate, while fixing the other, can result in optimal dispersal when the attractor is placed asymmetrically. Finally, we describe a rare event regime, where the escape location is exponentially sensitive to the attractor positioning. Our results suggest that structures such as the MTOC allow for the sensitive control of the spatial and temporal features of transport and corresponding function under physiological conditions.},

Moreover, the scaled equation leads to the fast diﬀusion ﬂow under the low ﬁeld limit. The relative phi-entropy method enables us to see the connection between the overdamped dynamics of the nonlinearly coupled kinetic model and the correlated fast diﬀusion. The global in time quantitative diﬀusion asymptotics is then derived by combining entropic hypocoercivity, relative phi-entropy and barrier function methods.},

	abstract = {As nutrients travel through microcirculation and are absorbed, their availability continuously decreases. However, a uniform nutrient distribution is critical, as it prevents tissue death in poorly supplied areas. How, then, do vascular networks achieve equi-perfusion? Given the extensive number of vessels in animal vascular systems, the structure of smaller vessels cannot be fully genetically predetermined and thus relies on a self-organizing developmental mechanism. We propose a simple, optimization-based adaptation rule to control vessel radii, aiming to equalize perfusion while minimizing flow resistance and material cost. This adaptation balances three competing factors: perfusion efficiency, energy dissipation, and material expenditure, which together drive complex network morphologies. These morphologies range from hierarchical architectures optimized for minimal resistance and material cost to dense networks that achieve efficient perfusion. Notably, metabolic demand is the primary factor modulating the transition between these contrasting structures. By applying our adaptation rule to networks in the rat mesentery and comparing the resulting optimal perfusion architectures with the experimental data, we can estimate the biologically relevant parameters, such as the oxygen absorption rate, for which the optimization and experimental networks align the most. Surprisingly, the optimal absorption rate we derive matches independent in vivo measurements. This suggests that reduced-order models like ours can provide valuable insights into the development and function of real vascular networks.},

	abstract = {The paper discusses how neural and mental processes correlate for developing cognitive abilities like memory or spatial representation and allowing the emergence of higher cognitive processes up to embodied cognition, consciousness and creativity. It is done via the presentation of MENS (for Memory Evolutive Neural System), a mathematical methodology, based on category theory, which encompasses the neural and mental systems and analyzes their dynamics in the process of ‘becoming’. Using the categorical notion of a colimit, it describes the generation of mental objects through the iterative binding of distributed synchronous assemblies of neurons, and presents a new rationale of spatial representation in the hippocampus (Gomez-Ramirez and Sanz, 2011). An important result is that the degeneracy of the neural code (Edelman, 1989) is the property allowing for the formation of mental objects and cognitive processes of increasing complexity order, with multiple neuronal realizabilities; it is essential “to explain certain empirical phenomena like productivity and systematicity of thought and thinking (Aydede 2010)”. Rather than restricting the discourse to linguistics or philosophy of mind, the formal methods used in MENS lead to precise notions of Compositionality, Productivity and Systematicity, which overcome the dichotomic debate of classicism vs. connectionism and their multiple facets. It also allows developing the naturalized phenomenology approach asked for by Varela (1996) which “seeks articulations by mutual constraints between phenomena present in experience and the correlative ﬁeld of phenomena established by the cognitive sciences”, while avoiding their pitfalls.},

The explicit expression of the covariant derivative leads to a deﬁnition of the Riemannian shape Hessian with respect to the ﬁrst Sobolev metric. In this paper, we give a brief overview of various optimization techniques based on the gradients and the Hessian. Since the space of smooth shapes limits the application of the optimization techniques, this paper extends the deﬁnition of smooth shapes to H1/2-shapes, which arise naturally in shape optimization problems. We deﬁne a diﬀeological structure on the new space of H1/2-shapes. This can be seen as a ﬁrst step towards the formulation of optimization techniques on diﬀeological spaces.},

We give a sample of possible applications including asymptotic behavior in the large, singular perturbations, exact boundary conditions on artificial boundaries and validity of maximum principles.

	abstract = {The renal medulla produces concentrated urine through the generation of an osmotic gradient that progressively increases from the cortico-medullary boundary to the inner medullary tip. In the outer medulla, the osmolality gradient arises principally from vigorous active transport of NaCl, without accompanying water, from the thick ascending limbs of short- and longlooped nephrons. In the inner medulla, the source of the osmotic gradient has not been identiﬁed. Recently, there have been important advances in our understanding of key components of the urine-concentrating mechanism, including (a) better understanding of the regulation of water, urea, and sodium transport proteins; (b) better resolution of the anatomical relationships in the medulla; and (c) improvements in mathematical modeling of the urine-concentrating mechanism. Continued experimental investigation of signaling pathways regulating transepithelial transport, both in normal animals and in knockout mice, and incorporation of the resulting information into mathematical simulations may help to more fully elucidate the mechanism for concentrating urine in the inner medulla.},

Classic phase portraits are limited to two dimensions and occasionally snapshots of 3D phase portraits are presented; unfortunately, a single point of view of a third or higher order system usually implies information losses. To solve that limitation, some authors used an additional degree of freedom to represent phase portraits in three dimensions, for example color graphics. Other authors perform states combinations, empirically, to represent higher dimensions, but the question remains whether it is possible to extend the two-dimensional phase portraits to higher order and their mathematical basis. In this paper, it is reported that the combinations of states to generate a set of phase portraits is enough to determine without loss of information the complete behavior of the immediate system dynamics for a set of initial conditions in an n-dimensional state space. Further, new graphical tools are provided capable to represent methodically the phase portrait for higher order systems.},

	abstract = {A stochastic model of climate variability is considered in which slow changes of climate are explained as the integral response to continuous random excitation by short period “weather” disturbances. The coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-land system is divided into a rapidly varying “weather” system (essentially the atmosphere) and a slowly responding “climate” system (the ocean, cryosphere, land vegetation, etc.). In the usual Statistical Dynamical Model (SDM) only the average transport effects of the rapidly varying weather components are parameterised in the climate system. The resultant prognostic equations are deterministic, and climate variability can normally arise only through variable external conditions. The essential feature of stochastic climate models is that the non-averaged “weather” components are also retained. They appear formally as random forcing terms. The climate system, acting as an integrator of this short-period excitation, exhibits the same random-walk response characteristics as large particles interacting with an ensemble of much smaller particles in the analogous Brownian motion problem. The model predicts “red” variance spectra, in qualitative agreement with observations. The evolution of the climate probability distribution is described by a Fokker-Planck equation, in which the effect of the random weather excitation is represented by diffusion terms. Without stabilising feedback, the model predicts a continuous increase in climate variability, in analogy with the continuous, unbounded dispersion of particles in Brownian motion (or in a homogeneous turbulent fluid). Stabilising feedback yields a statistically stationary climate probability distribution. Feedback also results in a finite degree of climate predictability, but for a stationary climate the predictability is limited to maximal skill parameters of order 0.5.},

During this process, neurons extend neurites—axons and dendrites—to meet other neurons and interconnect. Therefore, these neurites need to migrate, grow, branch and find the correct path to their target by processing sensory cues from their environment. These processes rely on many coupled biophysical effects including elasticity, viscosity, growth, active forces, chemical signaling, adhesion and cellular transport. Mathematical models offer a direct way to test hypotheses and understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for neuron development. Here, we critically review the main models of neurite growth and morphogenesis from a mathematical viewpoint. We present different models for growth, guidance and morphogenesis, with a particular emphasis on mechanics and mechanisms, and on simple mathematical models that can be partially treated analytically.},

Despite a significant body of research, the underlying cytoskeletal mechanics of growth and guidance are not fully understood, and the relative contributions of individual cytoskeletal processes to neurite growth are controversial. Here, we review the structural organization and biophysical properties of neurons to make a semi-quantitative comparison of the relative contributions of different processes to neurite growth. From this, we develop the idea that neurons are active fluids, which generate strong contractile forces in the growth cone and weaker contractile forces along the axon. As a result of subcellular gradients in forces and material properties, actin flows rapidly rearward in the growth cone periphery, and microtubules flow forward in bulk along the axon. With this framework, an integrated model of neurite outgrowth is proposed that hopefully will guide new approaches to stimulate neuronal growth.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

At time 0 of the film (1 day in culture), there are many neurites (white arrows) with similar lengths. They are highly dynamic, extending and retracting for short distances. One of these neurites became an axon (black arrow) that elongate faster and becames longer than the others. At 17:01 h of the film (1 day 17 hours of culture) the axon begins to branch while it continues to grow. 
Neurons sometimes establish connections with plural targets by axonal branches. While the primary axonal branch extends, the collateral branches appear to be suppressed in the same  
neuron.

	abstract = {Predicting the evolution of expanding populations is critical to controlling biological threats such as invasive species and cancer metastasis. Expansion is primarily driven by reproduction and dispersal, but nature abounds with examples of evolution where organisms pay a reproductive cost to disperse faster. When does selection favor this “survival of the fastest”? We searched for a simple rule, motivated by evolution experiments where swarming bacteria evolved into a hyperswarmer mutant that disperses ∼100\% faster but pays a growth cost of ∼10\% to make many copies of its flagellum. We analyzed a two-species model based on the Fisher equation to explain this observation: the population expansion rate (v) results from an interplay of growth (r) and dispersal (D) and is independent of the carrying capacity: 𝑣=2⁢(𝑟𝐷)1/2
v=2⁢(rD)1/2
. A mutant can take over the edge only if its expansion rate (v 2) exceeds the expansion rate of the established species (v 1); this simple condition (𝑣2{\textgreater}𝑣1
v2{\textgreater}v1
) determines the maximum cost in slower growth that a faster mutant can pay and still be able to take over. Numerical simulations and time-course experiments where we tracked evolution by imaging bacteria suggest that our findings are general: less favorable conditions delay but do not entirely prevent the success of the fastest. Thus, the expansion rate defines a traveling wave fitness, which could be combined with trade-offs to predict evolution of expanding populations.},

Numerical solution of the model on a two-dimensional domain gives population distributions qualitatively similar to those observed. We suggest that competition alone could account for the observed displacement of the red squirrel by the grey in large regions of Britain. The solutions are qualitatively similar to those for a single species spreading in the absence of competition. The quantitative difference is because competition slows down the speed of advance of the invading species.},

(2014), using diffusion operators, into spatio-temporal models, in order to study the long term dynamics of a mosaic of forest and grassland in a humid context of Central Africa. We take into account local biomass diffusion, as well as local tree–grass competition for nutrients and light. For this model, we carry out a qualitative analysis that highlights some ecological thresholds shaping the dynamics of the system. In addition, we show that monostable and bistable travelling wave solutions may exist. We illustrate some of our theoretical results with numerical simulations, and, also explore the use of impulsive fires on the dynamics of a mosaic of forest and grassland in a humid savanna. We found that depending on fire-return time as well as difference in diffusion potential of woody and herbaceous vegetation, fire events are able to greatly slow down or even stop the progression of forest in humid regions.},

How such tracer particles are mixed, transported, and dispersed by turbulent flow has been successfully described by statistical models. Heavy particles, with mass densities larger than that of the carrying fluid, can detach from the flow. This results in preferential sampling, small-scale fractal clustering, and large relative velocities. To describe these effects of particle inertia, one must consider both particle positions and velocities in phase space. In recent years, statistical phase-space models have significantly contributed to our understanding of inertial-particle dynamics in turbulence. These models help to identify the key mechanisms and nondimensional parameters governing the particle dynamics and have made qualitative and, in some cases, quantitative predictions. This article reviews statistical phase-space models for the dynamics of small, yet heavy, spherical particles in turbulence. We evaluate their effectiveness by comparing their predictions with results from numerical simulations and laboratory experiments, and we summarize their successes and failures.},
